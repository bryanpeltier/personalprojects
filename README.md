The NHL DMan Metric Model scrapes play-by-play reports from the NHL website to create a new 2-dimensional hockey statistic used to measure the puck moving abilities of NHL defensemen.  By calculating the average time it takes a defenseman to clear a puck from their defensive zone and the percentage of shifts where they don't achieve a successful zone clear, it becomes possible to visualize the differences in relative puck-moving abilities between different defensemen.  The data is sourced from the play-by-play reports published on the NHL website, while pieces of the scraper were taken from TopDownHockey's webscraper on their public GitHub.  Currently, the San Jose Sharks and Los Angeles Kings are the only teams supported, but the other 30 NHL teams should be supported shortly along with an option to visualize defensemen from multiple teams simultaneously.

The NHL contract model regresses various on-ice statistics sourced from Natural Stat Trick against their total cap hit for various San Jose Sharks forwards in the '23-'24 season, coming up with a model to predict total cap hit off of various on-ice statistics.  We can then visualize which players are performing above or below their expected total cap hit so far in the '24-'25 season using their current on-ice statistics to come up with an expected value for those on-ice metrics.
